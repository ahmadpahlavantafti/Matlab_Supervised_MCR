Supervised machine-written character recognition in Matlab.
Machine-Written character recognition is one among the abilities of a computer to 
recognize input characters from external sources such as e-forms, e-letters, and e-documents. 
The field of character recognition can make appropriate ways to regenerate such a text 
format from official electronic documents, providing textual information for different 
Enterprise Class Applications (ECA) such as G-2-G, B-2-B, and B-2-C. Artificial Neural Networks 
expose a great ability to interpret intelligible the input machine-written characters to 
digitized characters which could be stored in a computer file for further processing purposes. 
The objective of this research project is to implement an offline machine-written system for 
lower case English characters. We show that a machine-written character recognition system could 
be implemented using supervised classification approach. Several experiments on performed on synthetic 
data to validate the speed and accuracy of the proposed method. Source code (Matlab) is available in this repository.
